				<p>Lorem Ipsum: variants and technical information

Adobe Fireworks Lorem Ipsum plugin Cicero famously orated against his 
political opponent Lucius Sergius Catilina. Occasionally the first 
Oration against Catiline is taken for type specimens: 
Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra? Quam diu etiam 
furor iste tuus nos eludet? (How long, O Catiline, 
will you abuse our patience? And for how long will that madness of yours mock us?)<br/>

In 1985 Aldus Corporation launched its first desktop publishing program Aldus PageMaker for Apple Macintosh computers, 
released in 1987 for PCs running Windows 1.0. Both contained the variant lorem ipsum most common today. Laura Perry, 
then art director with Aldus, modified prior versions of Lorem Ipsum text from typographical specimens; in the 1960s 
and 1970s it appeared often in lettering catalogs by Letraset. Anecdotal evidence has it that Letraset used Lorem ipsum 
already from 1970 onwards, eg. for grids (page layouts) for ad agencies. Many early desktop publishing programs, eg. 
Adobe PageMaker, used it to create templates.

diagonal layout based on Lorem Ipsum Most text editors like MS Word or Lotus Notes generate random lorem text when needed, 
either as pre-installed module or plug-in to be added. Word selection or sequence don't necessarily match the original, 
which is intended to add variety. 
Presentation software like Keynote or Pages use it as a samples for screenplay layout. Content management software as Joomla!, 
Drupal, Mambo, PHP-Nuke, WordPress, 
or Movable Type offer Lorem Ipsum plug-ins with the same functionality.
